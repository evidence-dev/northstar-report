<Details title=Definition>

AOV is the *Average Order Value*, the amount a customer spends on an order, net of tax. It excludes B2B revenue which otherwise skews the metric siginificantly.

## Output KPIs


<Details title="Why these metrics?">


We can break down our revenue as follows:

<Mermaid id=sales>
graph LR
  sales --> aov[$ AOV]
  sales[$ Sales] --> orders["## Orders"]
  orders --> paid-orders["Paid Orders"]
  orders --> organic-orders["Organic Orders"]
</Mermaid>

### 2. Customer Experience (Product & Customer Service teams)

<Details title="Why these metrics?">

We know that organic orders (repeat purchases and referrals) are driven by **great customer experience**.

<Mermaid id=organic>
graph LR
  organic-orders["Orders"]-->cx["Great CX"]
  cx-->repeat_and_referral["Repeat Orders & Referrals"]
  repeat_and_referral-->organic-orders
</Mermaid>

The customer experience inputs we can control are:
- Speed to getting products
- Convenience of delivery
- Quality of products
- Range of available products (see merch team)

We tie one metric to each of these inputs.

</Details>



```sql range_sold
select 
  date_trunc('day', order_datetime) as day,
  count(distinct item) as range_sold
from orders
group by 1
order by 1 desc
limit 90
```

```sql time_to_delivery
select
  date_trunc('day', order_datetime) as day,
  avg(extract(epoch from delivery_slot_start - order_datetime) / 60 / 60 / 24) as days_to_delivery_slot
from deliveries
group by 1
order by 1 desc
limit 90
```

```sql delivery_status
select
  date_trunc('day', delivery_time) as day,
  case 
    when delivery_time < delivery_slot_start then 'Early'
    when delivery_time > delivery_slot_end then 'Late'
    else 'On Time'
  end as delivery_status,
  count(*) as deliveries
from deliveries
group by 1, 2
order by 1 desc
```


```sql delivery_on_time
SELECT
  day,
  SUM(CASE WHEN delivery_status = 'Early' THEN deliveries ELSE 0 END) AS early_deliveries,
  SUM(CASE WHEN delivery_status = 'Late' THEN deliveries ELSE 0 END) AS late_deliveries,
  SUM(CASE WHEN delivery_status = 'On Time' THEN deliveries ELSE 0 END) AS on_time_deliveries,
  ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN delivery_status = 'Early' THEN deliveries ELSE 0 END) / SUM(deliveries), 2) AS early_percentage,
  ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN delivery_status = 'Late' THEN deliveries ELSE 0 END) / SUM(deliveries), 2) AS late_percentage,
  ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN delivery_status = 'On Time' THEN deliveries ELSE 0 END) / SUM(deliveries), 2) AS on_time_percentage
FROM ${delivery_status}
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1 DESC
limit 90
```

```sql returns_by_by_reason
select 
date_trunc('day',order_datetime) as day,
reason,
count(*) as returns
from returns
left join orders on order_id=orders.id
where reason ilike '%Quality%' 
 or reason ilike '%Damaged%' 
 or reason ilike '%Defective product%'
 or reason ilike '%wrong%'
 or reason ilike '%match%'
group by 1,2
order by 1 desc

```

```sql monthly_returns_by_reason
select
  date_trunc('month', day) as month_num,
  monthname(day) as month,
  reason,
  sum(returns) as returns
from ${returns_by_by_reason}

```

```sql returns_abs

  count(*) as returns
from ${returns_by_by_reason}

```



```sql returns_percent
select 
  returns_abs.day,

### 3. Capacity (Ops Team)

<Details title="Why these metrics?">

It is important to manage our capacity:
- **Enough**: So we deliver short lead times for our customers, and drivers shifts are not too full
- **Not too much:** So we don't pay for unused capacity

</Details>


```sql truck_capacity
select * from trucks
```


```sql deliveries_by_truck
select 
  date_trunc('day', delivery_slot_start) as day,
  truck_number,
  capacity,
  count(*) as deliveries,
  
from deliveries
left join trucks on deliveries.truck_number = trucks.id
group by 1,2,3
```


```sql utilisation
select 
  day,
  sum(deliveries) as deliveries,
  count(distinct truck_number) as trucks,
  sum(capacity) as capacity,
  sum(deliveries) / sum(capacity) as utilisation
from ${deliveries_by_truck}
group by 1
order by 1 desc
limit 90
offset 4
```

<BigValue
  data={utilisation}
  value=trucks
  title="Trucks"
/>

<BigValue
  data={utilisation}
  value=capacity
  title="Delivery Capacity*"
/>

<BigValue
  data={utilisation}
  value=deliveries
  title="Deliveries"
/>


<BigValue
  data={utilisation}
  value=utilisation
  title="Truck Utilisation"
  fmt=pct
/>

\* This assumes an empirical capacity of 10 deliveries per truck per day. In reality this depends on the size of items and the routes.

  data={utilisation}
  title="Trucks, Last 90 Days"
  x=day

### 4. Product Offering (Merch team)

```sql average_price
select 
  date_trunc('day', order_datetime) as day,
  avg(sales) as average_price,
  avg(sales) / lag(avg(sales)) over (order by day) -1 as average_price_growth
from orders
group by 1 
order by 1 desc
limit 90
```

<BigValue
  data={range_sold}
  value=range_sold
  title="Product Lines"
/>

<BigValue
  data={average_price}
  value=average_price
  title="Average Price"
  fmt=usd2
  comparison=average_price_growth
  comparisonFmt=pct1
/>

Note that our website currently limits customers to buying one item per order, meaning that our average price is the same as our AOV.

Allowing multiple items per order should significantly increase our AOV.
